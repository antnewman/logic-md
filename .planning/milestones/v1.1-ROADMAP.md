# Roadmap: logic-md

## Overview

This roadmap takes logic-md from zero to a complete CLI toolkit for parsing, validating, and compiling LOGIC.md files. The work flows from project scaffolding through the core library modules (parser, validator, expression engine, DAG resolver, import resolver), then up to the CLI layer, and finally a dedicated testing and integration phase to hit 90%+ coverage. Each phase delivers a coherent, independently verifiable capability.

## Milestones

## Phase Details

### Phase 10: Compiler Types & Foundation

**Depends on**: Phase 9 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements**: TYPE-01, TYPE-02, CNST-01, CNST-02, CNST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ExecutionContext, CompiledStep, CompiledWorkflow, QualityGate, RetryPolicy, and WorkflowContext types exist in types.ts and are importable from packages/core
  2. A developer importing from packages/core can access all new types without reaching into internal paths
  3. The compiler module skeleton exists with function signatures that accept and return the new types (pure functions, no I/O)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md -- Add compiler types to types.ts, create compiler.ts skeleton with pure-function stubs, update barrel exports

### Phase 11: Step Compiler Core

**Requirements**: COMP-01, COMP-02, COMP-03, COMP-06, COMP-09, COMP-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Calling `compileStep(spec, stepName, context)` returns a CompiledStep with a systemPromptSegment containing the reasoning strategy preamble, step instructions, and output format instructions
  2. The systemPromptSegment is human-readable plain text that a developer can inspect and debug
  3. Output schema compilation produces instructions that work for both JSON mode and function-calling mode LLM interfaces
  4. The returned CompiledStep includes outputSchema, qualityGates, retryPolicy, and metadata fields
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: COMP-04, COMP-05, COMP-07, COMP-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a step is reached via a decision branch, the prompt segment explains why this branch was taken and what alternatives exist
  2. When a step is being retried, the prompt segment includes the attempt number and the reason the previous attempt failed
  3. Steps with confidence thresholds include instructions requiring the agent to meet the minimum confidence level
  4. Steps with active quality gates include a "Before responding, verify: ..." checklist in the prompt segment
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: GATE-01, GATE-02, GATE-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A quality gate with a `check` expression compiles to an executable function `(output) => { passed, message? }` that evaluates using the expression engine
  2. Self-reflection gates compile to a follow-up prompt template containing the rubric and minimum score threshold
  3. Gate validators correctly pass or fail when given sample outputs (no false positives or negatives on test fixtures)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 13-01-PLAN.md -- TDD check-expression gate compilation: step verification + spec pre_output gates to validator functions
- [ ] 13-02-PLAN.md -- TDD self-reflection compilation: rubric/reflection strategies to prompt templates with minimum scores

**Requirements**: TOKN-01, TOKN-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `estimateTokens(text)` returns an approximate count using the ~4 chars/token heuristic
  2. Compiled prompt segments that exceed 2000 tokens include a warning in the compilation result
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 14-01-PLAN.md -- TDD estimateTokens implementation and tokenWarning integration in compileStep

**Depends on**: Phase 12, Phase 13
**Requirements**: WKFL-01, WKFL-02, WKFL-03, WKFL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `compileWorkflow(spec, context)` returns a CompiledWorkflow with steps ordered by the DAG resolver's `_dagLevels`
  2. Each step in the compiled workflow is pre-compiled via compileStep (not deferred)
  3. Steps at the same DAG level are grouped as parallel-executable
  4. Global quality gates and fallback policies from the spec are attached to the compiled workflow
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 15-01-PLAN.md -- TDD compileWorkflow: DAG-ordered pre-compiled steps with global quality gates and fallback policies

### Phase 16: CLI Compile Step
**Goal**: Developers can compile individual steps from the command line and see self-reflection prompts when applicable
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: CLIU-01, CLIU-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `logic-md compile example.logic.md --step analyze` compiles and outputs only the specified step
  2. When a step has self-reflection enabled, the CLI output includes the self-reflection prompt alongside the compiled step
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 16-01-PLAN.md -- TDD --step flag: CLI arg parsing, single-step compilation with self-reflection output

### Phase 17: Compiler Test Coverage
**Goal**: The compiler module has 90%+ test coverage with tests covering every workflow shape and edge case
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: CTST-01, CTST-02, CTST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. vitest coverage report shows 90%+ on all compiler module files (lines, branches, functions, statements)
  2. Tests cover linear workflows, branching workflows, retry context injection, and quality gate compilation
  3. Tests cover self-reflection prompts, parallel step groups, token estimation warnings, and edge cases (no steps, single step, missing optional fields)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 17-01-PLAN.md -- TDD gap-filling tests for workflow shapes, self-reflection edge cases, and coverage verification

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17
Note: Phase 13 depends on Phase 11 (not 12), so 12 and 13 can run in parallel after 11. Phase 14 depends only on Phase 11.
