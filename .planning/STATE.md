# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-02)

**Core value:** Developers can define agent reasoning strategies in a portable, declarative file format -- parsed and validated by a standalone library.
**Current focus:** Phase 12: Step Compiler Context

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 17 (Step Compiler Context)
Plan: 01 of 02 -- COMPLETE
Status: Executing Phase 12
Last activity: 2026-04-02 -- Phase 12 Plan 01 executed

Progress: [############........] 65% (11/17 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 15 (12 v1.0 + 3 v1.1)
- Average duration: 3.8min
- Total execution time: 0.95 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 02 | 2 | 23min | 11.5min |
| 03 | 1 | 6min | 6min |
| 04 | 2 | 6min | 3min |
| 05 | 3 | 7min | 2.3min |
| 06 | 1 | 2min | 2min |
| 08 | 2 | 5min | 2.5min |
| 09 | 3 | 7min | 2.3min |

| 10 | 1 | 2min | 2min |
| 11 | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 12 | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 2min, 2min, 3min, 4min, 2min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All compiler functions are pure -- no side effects, no I/O, no LLM calls (CNST-01)
- Compiler reuses existing expression.ts, dag.ts, types.ts from v1.0
- No new dependencies for v1.1 (CNST-03)
- QualityGateValidator is a function type separate from QualityGates spec interface
- CompilerError class established as dedicated error type for compiler module
- Underscore-prefixed params used for stub function signatures
- Strategy preamble and step instructions joined with double newline for prompt readability
- DAG resolver called inline per compileStep (pure, no caching needed at this stage)
- Research-synthesizer fixture used as canonical test data for compiler tests
- maximumInterval defaults to initialInterval when specified, otherwise 60s (Temporal retry semantics)
- Output format instructions are model-agnostic: mention both JSON mode and structured output mode
- [Phase 12]: Branch/retry context inserted between step instructions and output schema segments
