# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-02)

**Core value:** Developers can define agent reasoning strategies in a portable, declarative file format -- parsed and validated by a standalone library.
**Current focus:** Phase 16: CLI Compile Step

## Current Position

Phase: 16 of 17 (CLI Compile Step) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 01 of 01 -- COMPLETE
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-04-02 -- Phase 16 Plan 01 executed

Progress: [#################...] 88% (16/17 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 16 (12 v1.0 + 4 v1.1)
- Average duration: 3.8min
- Total execution time: 0.95 hours

**By Phase:**

|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 02 | 2 | 23min | 11.5min |
| 03 | 1 | 6min | 6min |
| 04 | 2 | 6min | 3min |
| 05 | 3 | 7min | 2.3min |
| 06 | 1 | 2min | 2min |
| 08 | 2 | 5min | 2.5min |
| 09 | 3 | 7min | 2.3min |

| 10 | 1 | 2min | 2min |
| 11 | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 12 | 2 | 5min | 2.5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 2min, 3min, 4min, 2min, 3min
- Trend: Stable
| Phase 13 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 13 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 15 P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 16 P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All compiler functions are pure -- no side effects, no I/O, no LLM calls (CNST-01)
- Compiler reuses existing expression.ts, dag.ts, types.ts from v1.0
- No new dependencies for v1.1 (CNST-03)
- QualityGateValidator is a function type separate from QualityGates spec interface
- CompilerError class established as dedicated error type for compiler module
- Underscore-prefixed params used for stub function signatures
- Strategy preamble and step instructions joined with double newline for prompt readability
- DAG resolver called inline per compileStep (pure, no caching needed at this stage)
- Research-synthesizer fixture used as canonical test data for compiler tests
- maximumInterval defaults to initialInterval when specified, otherwise 60s (Temporal retry semantics)
- Output format instructions are model-agnostic: mention both JSON mode and structured output mode
- [Phase 12]: Branch/retry context inserted between step instructions and output schema segments
- [Phase 12]: Confidence requirements and quality gate checklists added after retry context in systemPromptSegment
- [Phase 12]: Gate name used as fallback when gate.message is missing in quality gate checklist
- [Phase 13]: Gate validators use evaluate() with { output } context injection
- [Phase 13]: Step verification gates ordered before spec pre_output gates in qualityGates array
- [Phase 13]: IIFE pattern used to build qualityGates array inline in compileStep return
- [Phase 13]: Rubric self-reflection prompt uses structured markdown with criteria name, weight, description
- [Phase 13]: Reflection strategy passes prompt through with minimumScore 0 (no numeric scoring)
- [Phase 13]: Default minimumScore is 0.5 for rubric when not specified
- [Phase 13]: Unsupported strategies (checklist, critic) return null for future extension
- [Phase 15]: compileWorkflow delegates to resolve() for DAG ordering and compileStep for per-step compilation
- [Phase 15]: Global quality gates compiled via existing compileGateValidator (module-private, no export needed)
- [Phase 15]: Empty steps handled as early return with zero-length arrays
- [Phase 15]: DAG errors propagated as CompilerError with joined error messages
- [Phase 16]: qualityGates functions replaced with qualityGateCount integer in CLI JSON output
- [Phase 16]: ExecutionContext built with defaults (attemptNumber 1, null branch/failure) for CLI single-step compile
