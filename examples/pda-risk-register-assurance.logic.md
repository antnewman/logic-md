# PDA Risk Register Assurance — Reasoning Documentation

## Purpose

This worked example documents an eight-step assurance workflow for processing
a UK-government project delivery artefact (a periodic report, business case,
or PRINCE2 product description). The output is a triaged risk register
written to an assurance store with a full provenance trail suitable for
board-level review and external audit.

The example deliberately stresses four LOGIC.md features simultaneously,
each of which is sparsely covered by existing fixtures and templates:

1. **Rubric-based self-verification** (`quality_gates.self_verification.strategy: rubric`)
2. **Write-segregated per-step `allowed_tools`** — each step can only access
   the tools its role requires; the four-axis segregation (read / no-LLM /
   LLM-with-search / write) is enforceable, not advisory
3. **`human_review_gate` as a first-class step** — not a flag on an LLM step,
   not an action in `fallback.escalation`
4. **Provenance metadata flowing through every step's contract** — the audit
   trail is a typed first-class output, not an afterthought tacked on at the end

## Strategy rationale

`plan-execute` is chosen over ReAct because the workflow's structure is fixed
in advance — a regulated assurance pipeline does not benefit from interleaved
search and reasoning at every step. The DAG is the plan; each step executes
its role. Temperature is held to 0.2: determinism is more valuable than
creativity in assurance work, and reviewers must be able to reproduce results.

## Tool-segregation pattern

The eight steps partition cleanly across five tool families. Every step
declares both `allowed_tools` and (where load-bearing) `denied_tools`. A
runtime that respects the declarations cannot, for example, allow
`extract_risks` to write to the assurance store even if the LLM hallucinates
a tool call.

| Tool family | Steps | Why this segregation |
|---|---|---|
| Read-only document tools | `ingest_artefact` | Byte-level extraction only; no summarisation |
| Schema validators (no LLM) | `validate_artefact` | Validation is deterministic; LLM access denied |
| LLM with knowledge-base search | `extract_risks`, `triage`, `emit_report` | Reasoning steps; explicitly denied write tools and document_reader |
| Read-only assurance store | `outlier_scan` | Compares against history; cannot mutate |
| Human review (no LLM) | `human_review_gate` | Only `human_review_request`; LLM denied |
| Write-only assurance store | `persist` | Only step with write capability; LLM and read-tools denied |

## `human_review_gate` as a first-class step

A common anti-pattern is to model human review as a flag on an LLM step
(e.g. `requires_review: true`) or as an `action` in `fallback.escalation`.
Both approaches lose the structural information that *the workflow halts
here until a human acts*.

Modelling it as a first-class step has three concrete benefits:

1. **DAG visibility** — the step appears in the workflow graph; downstream
   steps explicitly `needs: [human_review_gate]` and a runtime can refuse to
   execute them until the gate completes.
2. **Tool-permission enforcement** — the step's `allowed_tools` is exactly
   `[human_review_request]` and nothing else; LLM access is explicitly
   denied. No automated substitution is possible.
3. **Auditability** — the step has its own contract (`reviewer_id`,
   `decision_timestamp`, `per_risk_decisions`), which becomes part of the
   provenance trail at the same level as every other step's output, viewable
   in the same place.

The gate is a step rather than a `quality_gates.pre_output` check because
quality gates run *during* an LLM step's output cycle; this gate must run
*between* steps and block the DAG.

## Provenance convention

Every step output includes a `provenance` object with consistent fields
(`step_chain`, `timestamp`, plus contextual fields like `confidence`,
`reviewer_id`, `source_artefact_id` where applicable). This is repeated by
convention rather than enforced by a single shared schema fragment — see
[Spec edges encountered](#spec-edges-encountered) below.

The terminal `assurance_record` contract collects the full provenance trail
into the workflow output, where it travels with the persisted record into
the assurance store. A consumer of the assurance record can reconstruct
which steps ran, when, and which human reviewer authorised the persist.

## Failure modes and fallbacks

| Trigger | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `validate_artefact.output.valid == false` | Verification fails, step `aborts` with a structured message; no LLM cost incurred downstream. |
| `extract_risks.confidence < 0.5` | Retry up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff, then escalate to `tot` strategy. |
| `human_review_gate` exceeds 72h timeout | Step times out; the assurance lead is notified; no auto-approval. |
| Five total retry attempts | Workflow aborts. Failed runs are recorded but no partial output is persisted. |

## Self-verification rubric

The five rubric criteria are weighted to reflect what an external auditor
would check first if asked to verify an assurance record:

- **Source grounding (0.30)** — the most-checked property in audit
- **Provenance completeness (0.25)** — required to defend the record
- **Outlier explanation (0.20)** — defence against rubber-stamping
- **Human review compliance (0.15)** — gate integrity
- **Report clarity (0.10)** — communication, not assurance correctness

`minimum_score: 0.75` reflects that any score below this is below the
threshold an audit would tolerate, not below "perfect."

## Spec edges encountered

These are observations from drafting this example that may inform future
LOGIC.md spec evolution. None block this example's correctness against
v1.0.

1. **No workflow-local `$ref` in `output_schema`.** The `provenance` shape
   would benefit from a single source of truth referenced from each step.
   Today it is repeated by convention. A small `definitions:` block at the
   spec level, addressable from `output_schema` via `$ref`, would help.
2. **`human_review_gate` is implicit in v1.0.** No explicit step type
   distinguishes "this step waits for a human" from a regular instruction
   step. The pattern is encoded entirely via `allowed_tools`,
   `denied_tools`, and `verification`. A first-class step type
   (e.g. `kind: human_gate`) would make runtime gating less error-prone.
3. **Tool-name registry is implicit.** Names like `assurance_store_write`,
   `human_review_request`, and `report_renderer` are conventional in this
   example; nothing in the spec defines a canonical tool taxonomy. A small
   registry pattern (similar to MCP tool naming conventions) would help
   cross-spec interoperability.
4. **Quality-gate invariants reference `steps.<name>.completed`.** This is
   used in `persist_only_after_review`. The expression engine accepts it,
   but the spec text does not document `steps.<name>.completed` as a
   stable variable. Worth confirming.
